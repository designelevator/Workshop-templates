# Workshop-templates

In leading innovation processes, through human center design approach, we have created and needed to adapt many templates to fit specific client needs. 

In this repository you will find a collection of them, organised (or not).

In the case where the templates were made specifically for a client, these are published here with their authorisation.

All these templates are here under a creative commons licence CC-BY-SA v.3.0.
--> You can download use and modify the templates
--> You may use them for commercial purpose
--> YOU MUST mention us as authors or creators of the original material in the new created material
--> YOU MUST share it under the same conditions as this material.

Have fun in your activities !
